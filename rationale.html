    <p1>The double digit economic growth and the consecutive rapid expansion of construction industry in 
        Ethiopia and becoming a complex and risk-laden venture results in high demand for having professionals
         on the field of construction technology and management.Mainly the gaps seen in construction technology, 
         construction engineering and construction management become clear on the execution of construction projects. 
         Inefficiencies in construction projects management, inadequacies in the adoptions of various construction 
         technologies and techniques, etc call for having an integrated profession beyond the design aspect at the 
         all phases of project life cycle (inception, planning, execution...). Moreover the expansion of infrastructure,
          the rapid urbanization, the transformation to industry, etc require more effective and efficient 
          construction professionals that are able to operate beyond the design and engineering aspects.
